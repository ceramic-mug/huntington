# huntington
Sandbox for modeling Huntington WV's physical ins and outs, energy consumption and supply pathways, economics, demographics and migration, and other salient features through space and time

## Step 1 - Define Boundary

Although spatial boundaries are ethnographically dependent, sometimes ambiguous, and usually changing over time, the formal definition of a spatial boundary for a given point in time is necessary for analysis of flows.

The most straightforward boundary choice for Huntington is the boundary defined by the US Census.

From Tigerline data > 2024 > Places > WV and extracted selected Huntington City boundary from WV place layer.

## Step 2 - Define Inputs

## Atmospheric data

Energy traveling into Huntington takes many forms. One of the key forms is atmospheric, which includes:

- Solar irradiation
- Wind
- Precipitation
- Temperature systems
- Pressure systems

Note that these are not independent. However, accounting for each and understanding their dependence will allow for near-comprehensive atmospheric energy flux calculation.
